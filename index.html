<h1>Ethan Ancell's Github Pages</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting. At the moment, the only purpose of this Github Pages site is to provide a place where a table of contents for a software manual required in a computational math course I am taking. If you are Dr. Koebbe, jump to that homework table of contents with the below link. Otherwise, thank you for visiting this super boring site that is costing Github probably 3 cents to host per year.</p>
