<h1>Ethan Ancell's Github Pages</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting. At the moment, the only purpose of this Github Pages site is to provide a place where a table of contents for a software manual required in a computational math course I am taking. If you are Dr. Koebbe, jump to that homework table of contents with <a href="https://ethanancell.github.io/math4610/hw_toc">this link</a>. Otherwise, thank you for visiting this super boring site.</p>
